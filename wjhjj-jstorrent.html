                            <p>This is my first Chromebook. I'm slowly figuring out the little differences between Chrome OS and Windows/Apple, but this one has me stumped: been using Pirate Bays for years w/ my Windows laptop, easy peasy. On the Chromebook, I'm getting the error "Google chrome OS can't open this page" every time I click "get this torrent." I've gone into my seetings and made sure the site is allowed; I've also allowed pop-ups to no avail. Any ideas? The error page is so useless. TIA for any advice I'm trying to create a torrent file for sharing, and there doesn't seem to be any option to do so. Am I missing something? If this is impossible with JSTorrent, I'd love to know any way to do this using a chromebook. My research has fallen flat so far. Thanks. I have had pretty good success with Transmission in terms of speed and stability via the Linux Beta that chromeOS has recently implemented. With that being said, I really miss simply clicking magnet links and my torrent client opening up automatically. I have been copying the links to my clipboard and opening with URL on Transmission. Does anyone have a better method or any recommendations? I had my eyes on JSTorrent from the WebStore, but it hasn't been updated in 3 years. Flud from the PlayS. Hi everyone! I've bought JSTorrent a few weeks ago, and while I was pretty happy with it, it started acting weird a few days ago, despite upping the maximum connexion number to the maximum. So, to explain, while my torrents sometimes reach a regular speed (2-15mb/s, I have a good bandwidth), they sometimes just don't download, or load at a ludicrous speed (a few b/s) despite having numerous seeds. https://i.redd.it/za642ebsvqe21.png I've tried rebooting my ChromeBook, my router. I am using DotVPN in chrome. How can I configure JSTorrent that JSTorrent use DotVPN proxy. I downloaded jsTorrent just now from the web store, and when I run the program none of the buttons do anything. I cant add a magnet url either. Any help would be appreciated. 
Title, quick question. I had JStorrent handling magnet links before, but now that I removed it Transmission doesn't try to ask to handle magnet links it seems. sudo apt-get install transmission-qt, for the curious. Android integration is great for a lot of purposes but I find myself preferring Chrome apps for many things because the nativeness of the interface makes things better in many subtle ways \(being able to see the SD Card and Google Drive, right\-click, keyboard shortcuts\). So here's a list of the Chrome apps I use: 1. JSTorrent \- best torrent client for ChromeOS bar none 2. Writer \- text editor apps get a lot of discussion here, but it's usually centered around developers' needs. I'm a writer. Because technology is always moving forward; I would like to shake this tree again to see what falls out. Got a neat chromebook for school, fearless streaming thru those shady websites, and lovely torrenting. My goal was to do all the downloading on my chromebook and play all the media on a PS4 or some media player. My actual question is: What is the best way to torrent on a chromebook? It seems to have been JStorrent but after OS updates and other things, Im wondering if this is still Looks like the dev has let the domain expire, so the magnet link method that existed before no longer works. Anybody know a way to get it working like it used to before. 
I've considered purchasing JSTorrent because I've heard a lot about it, but at the same time I'm wondering if I should buy it at all when I can grab a client off the Play store for free. Any thoughts would be appreciated! Edit: Grammar. I don't have a system level VPN setup, but I have a Chrome extension that does VPN in the browser. Will it also handle the JSTorrent traffic? (This question has been asked already twice on this reddit community, but without an actual answer, so I'd like to give it another try.). Hello all, I’m using a Chromium on a Raspbian Stretch \(Raspberry Pi 3 B\+\). I have the “PIA \(Private Internet Access\)” extension installed and also have the “JS Torrent” extension for Chrome/Chromium. Q1: Will “JS Torrent” and “PIA” extensions work together? Q2: Is there a way to tell what IP address “JS Torrent” extension is using for WAN connection? Thanks in advance. 
If I download from the chrome store I always get an error when trying to download. When I install from github torrents download but seem to run larger than expected eg torrent size: 174mb, total downloaded 314mb  seems strange. Hi Guys, I just recently ordered my first chromebook, and it arrived today! (Dell Chromebook 11 3120). I know that it isn't one of the first to get android compatibility, but I was wondering what apps everyone is most excited to use on your chromebooks! Personally, I'm excited to: - Play a few simple games, such as Pixel Dungeon or Desktop Dungeons - Have a really solid Skype client, something traditional Linux has been missing for years - Kodi, assuming it works I know some people who role the dice and torrent without connecting to a VPN. They claim JSTorrent is encrypted and provides the same level of security. Is this really secure? Or should It hasn't been updated since March. Anyone know any new info? I sure hope the developer is still working on it, since it's currently the best (and pretty much the only) way to torrent on Chromebooks. I've had this app installed for a while now and it has worked just fine. Today, when I go to open it, it just doesn't open. I uninstall in order to reinstall it, but I can't find it on the chrome store anymore when i search for it (just the paid version). There is no mention of the lite version on the official site either. I had to search reddit to find a post made a long time ago that had the link to the lite version on the chrome store ( here (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jstorre.  I don't know if this is only me, I'm using JSTorrent Lite Version, and after 30-50 minutes, the download rate it's reduced to 1-2KBps, no joke, I have to stop the download, and start it again, and it will be back to 500-600K. So, is this a problem I can fix or is something in the lite version. 
So i have just downloaded jstorrent with web server chrome etc all you need to make it work. so when i add a torrent it shows no errors timeouts ,lasterror information and i have seeders too and connected to the peers but it only downloads 1 kb every 10 minutes. thanks for your help in advance. We've finally released an update to the world's most secure Torrent client JSTorrent (because it runs on ChromeOS!). It finally has magnet link support out-of-the-box and we've squished hundreds of bugs, and to boot, improved the download speeds significantly. Also as a bonus there's now a streaming feature that lets you start watching before you finished downloading. Please let me know if you have any problems or questions! You can grab it here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jstor. First off I'd like to Thank You. I haven't bee able to torrent since NORD VPN fucked my computer (closing port). So having this has really been awesome. But one thing I'd like to see is file selection before it begins downloading. The current method is after it has begun then select skip. There is no option for "file selection" in the settings. So if there is anything to improve it would be that. Or making a TOR Browser Version. I'm very happy with my purchase regardless & I'll tell anyone. JSTorrent opens as per usual but will not download any torrents. I did a powerwash and it even prompted me to select a target folder for the downloads. Anyone experience the same issue 
just got my Toshiba Chromebook 2 in the mail today. So far i love everything about this thing. I havent found a way yet to download torrents on to here. I use torrent websites as a last resort if i cant find what im looking for on Reddit. But what apps or ways have you been able to download torrents on Chrome. JSTorrent is a BitTorrent client for Google Chrome that downloads torrent files with ease. It can download torrents directly to your Downloads folder and can handle. Torrents get a bad rap, but there are plenty of legitimate and legal reasons for downloading them. While you can’t use BitTorrent itself on a Chromebook, there.
